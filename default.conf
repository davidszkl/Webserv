### info ###
# comments are allowed only here.
# cgi is executed if request points to valid .py file
# global scope config is not allowed (because I'm lazy)
# each statement must be followed by a ';' (like in C)
# first server that appears for a port is the default server for that port
### server scope ###
# error_page N /path/to/page -> almost like nginx
# server_name coucou.com -> like in nginx MANDATORY
# listen 80 -> like in nginx MANDATORY
# client_max_body_size 80 -> like in nginx but unit is byte only. 500 by default
### location scope ###
# index index.html -> like in nginx but only one file allowed
# root / location -> like in nginx but no regex
# autoindex on -> like in nginx (off by default)
# use GET -> allows GET method (only GET DELETE and POST are supported)
# redirect http://google.com -> like return 301 http://google.com in nginx
# upload_pass /path/to/store/posted/files -> enables file upload and sets file upload directory
